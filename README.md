# Leaderbord Project: Final version

> In this activity I will set up a JavaScript project for the Leaderboard list app, using webpack and ES6 features, notably modules. I will develop a first working version of the app following a wireframe, but without styling - just focus on functionality. In following activities, I will consume the Leaderboard API using JavaScript async and await and add some styling.
 
- Use callbacks and promises.
- Learn how to use proper ES6 syntax.
- Use ES6 modules to write modular JavaScript.
- Use webpack to bundle JavaScript.
